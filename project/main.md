# Unit 3 | Hotel Restaurant Manager Application

## Criteria A: Planning
### Problem Definition
My client, Mr. A, is the manager of a restaurant that is integrated into a hotel. While the restaurant ensures that all guests are provided with a seat, it also accepts non-guest visitors. Information of the guests is provided from the paper which the hotel manager gives in daily, while reservations by non-guest visitors are made directly to his restaurant through phone. Non-guest visitors are also allowed without reservations only if there is surplus in the seating.

Right now, the manager finds difficulty in taking a grasp of how many hotel guests, reservers and non-reserved visitors are in the restaurant at each moment, because all are being managed by paper. It is causing inefficiency by slowing down the process of bringing non-reserved visitors in, because of the difficulty in finding the total empty seats for the next two hours (which is one time slot for a reservation).
