Q1. What was the most proud moment for you during this project?

The most proud moment was when the application became functional and ready for actual use in real life situations. I had to develop a working code while trying out and learning completely new techniques that required a lot of troubleshooting. When the errors were no longer there and the code worked as intended, I was proud of myself.

Q2. What worked well this time?

The application had a distinct GUI that did not compare to other existing applications, that avoided unwanted inputs and was intuitive to use. Though the frame rate of the application severely dropped for each basic operation (not optimized), the user experience would be undoubtedly pleasant.

Q3. What will I do differently for P4 and the IA?

I will aim to finish the code itself in a very early stage, by working on it more consistently in the earlier stages of the time given for the project. In this project, the code finished right before the deadline and I was not able to give enough attention or time for documentation.

Q4. What are 3 things that I need help with?

1. I would need help with the correct vocabularies that should be used in the Criteria C. When I am writing descriptions of my code in Criteria C, I always get stuck with words if I am using the correct terminology for components in programming. (variable, parameter, module, method, algorithm, sequence, etc.)
2. I would need help with creating a timeline for the project. I always start the project without a timeline, so I often enlongate the process of coding and deprioritize documentations.
3. I would need help with identifying how much realism is required for the project. For example, my P3 had a customer page and a manager page which mutually made transactions of data using the database. The only function of the customer page was to send in a reservation for a specified restaurant id, and it is unrealistic that a customer would download a software only for the purpose. However, it was a requirement for the code to make transactions for the manager (main part of the program) mode to work, and I also had to justify the existence of such functionality, which I felt uncomfortable with. In this case, am I allowed to omit the softwares of the customer and assume that the data input is being done by an imaginary web application?
